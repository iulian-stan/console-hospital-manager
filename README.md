    ```
    mkdir build && cd build
    ```

2. Generate the project
    ```
    cmake ..
    ```

3. Build the project
    ```
    cmake --build .
    ```

4. Run the generated example
    ```
    > hospital.exe
    Hospital:

            1 - Staff

            2 - Patients

            3 - Action
